					<h1>Almog Klein - Portfolio<br /></h1>
					<p><strong><big>Data scientist | Electronics Engineer | Galactic Problem-Solver</big></strong></p>
					<p>Hello,

						My name is Almog Klein. I recently graduated with a master's degree in Intelligent Systems Engineering. My expertise includes machine learning models, statistics, algorithms, and Python programming. 
						Before my studies, I served in the IAF as an electrical engineer, where I led the development of optical observation systems.<br /><br />
						
						
						
						-> Some of the projects I have been working on:<br />
						
						ðŸ‘‰ Creating a bootstrap project for a basic chatbot system with access infrastructure to ChatGPT and Google Sheets. Deployment on an Amazon EC2 server.<br />
						
						ðŸ‘‰ Developing an Odor classification system- characterization of a process, setting up experiments, and examining the feasibility of a digital system for identifying and classifying odors. <br />
						
						ðŸ‘‰ Medical audio classification - developing a system for classifying audio samples as part of a decision support system for the surgeon during THR surgery.<br />
						
						ðŸ‘‰ Predicting water turbidity levels through IOT - developing a system that uses several databases to perform information fusion, training, and evaluation of 4 machine learning models and assembling a dedicated LSTM network for optimizing the sample time intervals.<br />
						
						I have successfully implemented classic machine learning models for classification, regression, and clustering tasks, using deep learning techniques and creating neural networks for image processing and time series prediction.
						
						Participate in Kaggle competitions with colleagues from my master's program and enjoy publishing and sharing posts on Medium. <br />
						
						I am seeking a position as a data scientist in the country's center, where I can contribute my skills and continue growing. 
						I am particularly interested in situations that involve working with sensor data, images, and medical and electrical signals. <br />
						
						If you are interested in connecting with me, you can reach me at almogklein.16@gmail.com or via LinkedIn.
